# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Week 7 Module

##Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to understand how many employees at Pewlett-Hackard are nearing retirment and how well the company is set up to replace retirees as they leave the work force.

##Results
-In total, there are 72,458 employees at Pewlett-Hackard that are at retirement age.
-Two titles are held by the majority of retiring employees, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.  These areas are open to the largest amount of risk with many retiring at one time.

-There are 1708 employees with mentorship eligibility currently employee at Pewlett-Hackard, far below the level of potential retirees. 
-Two titles are held by the majority of the mentorship eligible employees, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.

##Summary
In all, nearly 73,000 employees will retire from Pewlett-Hackard in the near term and will leave roles to be filled.  Currently, there are not enough mentor eligible employees to help train the next generation of employees at Pewlett-Hackard as each of the 1,708 mentors would need to take on approximately 43 mentees to fill the gap of those retiring. In order to ride the wave of the "silver tsunami", Pewlett-Hackard needs to evaluate the number of employees needed for Senior Staff and Senior Engineers, and put programs in place to increase engagement of younger employees at those levels.
